## 

## **A. INTRODUCTION**  {#a.-introduction}

This Employee Handbook is intended to provide employees with a general outline of HANNON HILL’s personnel policies, practices, and procedures.   This Handbook should not be read as setting forth the fine details of each policy or as constituting a guarantee that the policies it discusses will be applied in all cases.  The Handbook cannot anticipate every situation or answer every question about employment.  The Company must administer the policies and procedures contained in this Handbook with flexibility when it deems such action to be necessary.  The Company’s interpretation of these policies and procedures is final and binding.  

The personnel policies in this Handbook supersede and replace all prior published or unpublished polices.  The Company may add to the policies in the Handbook or revoke or modify them from time to time at its sole discretion.  The Company will try to keep the Handbook current, but there may be times when policies will change before this Handbook can be revised. 

**NEITHER THIS HANDBOOK NOR ANY PROVISION IN THIS HANDBOOK CONSTITUTES A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF CONTRACT.  THIS HANDBOOK IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR INFORMATION ONLY.  IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ANY WAY AS CREATING ANY RIGHTS, CONTRACT OR GUARANTEE OF EMPLOYMENT, BENEFITS, OR WORKING CONDITIONS BETWEEN ANY EMPLOYEE AND THE COMPANY.**

Thank you for taking the time to read and understand the Employee Handbook. You will be required to execute the Acknowledgment Form found at the end of this Handbook indicating that you have received, read, have had the opportunity to ask questions, and understand the policies contained in this Employee Handbook.  Should you have any questions about the policies contained in this Handbook, you should contact Human Resources \- hr@hannonhill.com

#### **AT WILL EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT** 

In consideration of my employment with HANNON HILL CORPORATION (the Company), I understand that my employment and compensation are at-will and therefore can be terminated, with or without cause, at any time without prior notice, at my option or the Company’s option. This at-will employment relationship will remain in effect throughout my employment with the Company unless it is specifically modified by an express written employment agreement executed by an authorized representative of the Company and me. I understand that this at-will employment relationship may not be modified by any oral or implied agreement, and that no employee handbook, nor any course of conduct, practice, policy, award, promotion, performance evaluation, transfer, or length of service can modify this at-will relationship.

##### **1.) EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY POLICY STATEMENT**  {#1.)-equal-employment-opportunity-policy-statement}

Equal Employment Opportunity has been, and will continue to be, a fundamental principle at HANNON  HILL, where employment is based upon personal capabilities and qualifications without discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, or any other protected characteristic as established by law.

 

This policy of Equal Employment Opportunity applies to all policies and procedures relating to recruitment and hiring, compensation, benefits, termination and all other terms and conditions of employment.

 

The Human Resources Department has overall responsibility for this policy and maintains reporting and monitoring procedures. Employees' questions or concerns should be referred to the Human Resources Department.

 

Appropriate disciplinary action may be taken against any employee willfully violating this policy. 

##### **2.) ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY**  {#2.)-anti-harassment-policy}

HANNON HILL is committed to a work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. Each individual has the right to work in a professional atmosphere that promotes equal employment opportunities and prohibits discriminatory practices, including harassment. Therefore, HANNON HILL expects that all relationships among persons in the workplace will be business-like and free of bias, prejudice and harassment. 

**Definitions of Harassment** 

a. Sexual harassment constitutes discrimination and is illegal under federal, state and local laws. For the purposes of this policy, sexual harassment is defined, as in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Guidelines, as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when, for example: (i) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; ii) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or (iii) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 

Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not so subtle behaviors and may involve individuals of the same or different gender. Depending on the circumstances, these behaviors may include, but are not limited to: unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual jokes and innuendo; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual's body, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies; leering, catcalls or touching; insulting or obscene comments or gestures; display or circulation in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects or pictures (including through e-mail); and other physical, verbal or visual

conduct of a sexual nature. Sex-based harassment that is, harassment not involving sexual activity or language (e.g., male manager yells only at female employees and not males) may also constitute discrimination if it is severe or pervasive and directed at employees because of their sex. 

b. Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. Under this policy, harassment is verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, \[alienage or citizenship status, marital status, creed, genetic predisposition or carrier status, sexual orientation\] or any other characteristic protected by law or that of his/her relatives, friends or associates, and that: (i) has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment; (ii) has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance; or (iii) otherwise adversely affects an individual's employment opportunities. 

Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to: epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation in the workplace of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group (including through email). 

**Individuals and Conduct Covered** 

These policies apply to all applicants and employees, and prohibit harassment, discrimination and retaliation whether engaged in by fellow employees, by a supervisor or manager or by someone not directly connected to HANNON HILL (e.g., an outside vendor, consultant or customer). 

Conduct prohibited by these policies is unacceptable in the workplace and in any work-related setting outside the workplace, such as during business trips, business meetings and company-sponsored social events. 

**Reporting an Incident of Harassment, Discrimination or Retaliation** 

HANNON HILL strongly urges the reporting of all incidents of discrimination, harassment or retaliation, regardless of the offender's identity or position. Individuals who believe they have experienced conduct that they believe is contrary to HANNON HILL's policy or who have concerns about such matters should file their complaints with the Human Resource Manager before the conduct becomes severe or pervasive. 

**The Investigation** 

Any reported allegations of harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be investigated promptly, thoroughly and impartially. The investigation may include individual interviews with the parties involved and, where necessary, with individuals who may have observed the alleged conduct or may have other relevant knowledge. 

Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigatory process to the extent consistent with adequate investigation and appropriate corrective action. 

Individuals who have questions or concerns about these policies should talk with the Human Resources Manager.

Appropriate disciplinary action may be taken against any employee willfully violating this policy up to and including termination. 

##### 

HANNON HILL is committed to complying with all applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). It is HANNON HILL’s policy not to discriminate against any qualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of such individual's disability or perceived disability so long as the employee can perform the essential functions of the job. Consistent with this policy of nondiscrimination, HANNON HILL will provide reasonable accommodations to a qualified individual with a disability, as defined by the ADA, who has made the company aware of his or her disability, provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue hardship on the organization. 

Employees with a disability who believe they need a reasonable accommodation to perform the essential functions of their job should contact the Human Resources Department. HANNON HILL encourages individuals with disabilities to come forward and request reasonable accommodation. 

**Procedure for Requesting an Accommodation** 

On receipt of an accommodation request, a member of the Human Resources Department and your supervisor will meet with you to discuss and identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and the potential accommodation that HANNON HILL might make to help overcome those limitations. 

HANNON HILL will determine the feasibility of the requested accommodation considering various factors, including, but not limited to the nature and cost of the accommodation, the availability of tax credits and deductions, outside funding, HANNON HILL's overall financial resources and organization, and the accommodation's impact on the operation of the HANNON HILL, including its impact on the ability of other employees to perform their duties and on HANNON HILL's ability to conduct business. 

The ADA does not require HANNON HILL to make the best possible accommodation, to reallocate essential job functions, or to provide personal use items (i.e., eyeglasses, hearing aids, wheelchairs etc.). 

An employee or job applicant who has questions regarding this policy or believes that he or she has been discriminated against based on a disability should notify the Human Resources Department. All such inquiries or complaints will be treated as confidential to the extent permissible by law. 

##### 

##### **3.) CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF WORK**  {#3.)-conflict-of-interest-and-confidential-nature-of-work}

HANNON HILL expects our employees to conduct business according to the highest ethical standards of conduct. Employees are expected to devote their best efforts to the interests of the company. Business dealings that appear to create a conflict between the interests of  HANNON HILL and an employee are unacceptable. HANNON HILL recognizes the right of employees to engage in activities outside of their employment which are of a private nature and unrelated to our business. However, all employees must adhere to the guidelines set forth in the HANNON HILL non-disclosure agreement and non-solicitation agreement. 

**Work Product Ownership** 

All HANNON HILL employees must be aware that HANNON HILL retains legal ownership of the product of their work. No work product created while employed by HANNON HILL can be claimed, construed, or presented as property of the individual, even after employment by HANNON HILL has been terminated or the relevant project completed. This includes written and electronic documents, audio and video recordings,system code, and also any concepts, ideas, or other intellectual property developed for HANNON HILL, regardless of whether the intellectual property is actually used by HANNON HILL. Although it is acceptable for an employee to display and/or discuss a portion or the whole of certain work product as an example in certain situations (e.g., on a resume, in a freelancer's meeting with a prospective client), one must bear in mind that information classified as confidential must remain so even after the end of employment, and that supplying certain other entities with certain types of information may constitute a conflict of interest. In any event, it must always be made clear that work product is the sole and exclusive property of HANNON HILL. Freelancers and temporary employees must be particularly careful in the course of any work they discuss doing, or actually do, for a competitor of HANNON HILL. 

**Confidential Nature of Work** 

All HANNON HILL records and information relating to HANNON HILL or its customers are confidential and employees must, therefore, treat all matters accordingly. No HANNON HILL or HANNON HILL-related information, including without limitation, documents, notes, files, records, oral information, computer files or similar materials (except in the ordinary course of performing duties on behalf of HANNON HILL) may be removed from HANNON HILL's premises without permission from HANNON HILL. Additionally, the contents of HANNON HILL's records or information otherwise obtained in regard to business may not be disclosed to anyone, except where required for a business purpose. Employees must not disclose any confidential information, purposefully or inadvertently through casual conversation), to any unauthorized person inside or outside the Company. Employees who are unsure about the confidential nature of specific information must ask their supervisor for clarification. Employees will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, for knowingly or unknowingly revealing information of a confidential nature. 

## **B. EMPLOYMENT**  {#b.-employment}

##### 

##### **1.) INITIAL EMPLOYMENT PERIOD**  {#1.)-initial-employment-period}

Every new employee will undergo an initial trial employment period of **60 days** in order to learn about HANNON HILL and about his/her job. During this time the employee will have an opportunity to find out if he/she is suited to, and likes, his/her new position. 

Additionally, the initial employment period gives the employee's supervisor a reasonable period of time to evaluate his/her performance. 

During this time, the new employee will be provided with training and guidance from his/her Supervisor. He/she may be discharged at any time during this period if his/her Supervisor concludes that he/she is not progressing or performing satisfactorily. Under appropriate circumstances, the initial employment may be extended. Additionally, as is true at all times during an employee's employment with HANNON HILL, employment is not for any specific time and may be terminated at will, with or without cause and without prior notice.

At the end of the initial employment period, the employee and his/her supervisor may discuss his/her performance. Provided his/her job performance is "satisfactory" at the end of the initial employment period, he/she will continue in our employment as an at-will employee. 

##### **2.) TRANSFERS AND PROMOTIONS**  {#2.)-transfers-and-promotions}

HANNON HILL encourages employees to assume higher-level positions or lateral transfers for which they qualify. Toward this end, HANNON HILL conducts career conversations that offer employees the opportunity to discuss with a member of the Human Resources department their goals, aspirations and strengths within their department and the company as a whole. 

Generally, employees must be in their job for at least one year before applying for a change in position. In addition, employees must have a good performance, attendance, and a manager’s recommendation. Each promotion or transfer is judged on an individual basis, dependent on the needs of both departments involved, and subject to approval at the discretion of leadership. 

All final decisions regarding transfers will be made by Management, in conjunction with the Human Resources Department. 

Employees who wish to apply for a transfer or promotion should discuss it first with their supervisor/manager and the Human Resources Department so that it may be determined if their skills fit the requirements of the desired job. Employees should also feel free to discuss their career aspirations with their supervisor/manager or the Human Resources Department at any time. 

## **C. COMPENSATION**  {#c.-compensation}

##### **1.) SALARY REVIEW PROGRAM**  {#1.)-salary-review-program}

Management and Human Resources will conduct regular performance reviews for all employees and will use evaluations to determine meritorious salary increases or bonus incentives for consistently demonstrated excellence from our salary-based and commissions-based personnel. HANNON HILL appreciates each employee’s contributions to our solid growth and success. 

Salary reevaluations may be conducted independent of a performance review on limited occasions including but not limited to significant changes in responsibilities and/or the employee obtaining a degree or certification related to the role. 

All salary reevaluations, cost of living increases and/ any associated retroactive pay, including those at the time of a performance review, are at the sole discretion of leadership and subject to approval by the CEO of Hannon Hill.


##### **2.) PAYMENT SCHEDULE** {#2.)-payment-schedule}

Compensation, whether paid on a salary or hourly basis is made twice per month on the 15th and last day of each month. If the normal payday falls on a company-recognized holiday or a weekend, payments will be made one business day prior to the aforementioned schedule. Under no circumstance will payments be released prior to the announced schedule. 

Payments may be paid by check or through direct deposit of funds to either a savings or checking account at the employee’s bank of choice (providing the bank has direct deposit capability). 

If an employee opts out of the direct deposit option, the employee’s paycheck will only be given personally to that employee. Any other arrangements for mailing or pick-up required by the employee must be made in advance and in writing with the Human Resources Department. 

Paystubs and other payroll-related forms will be available through the Rippling website. Human Resources will provide the employee with instructions to setup a login and password to the site. Please review each paystub for accuracy and report any questions or suspected discrepancies to Human Resources. 

The amount of federal and state withholding is affected by the number of exemptions claimed on Form W-4, and G-4 Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (or your respective state’s Withholding Allowance Form). If an employee's marital status changes or the number of exemptions previously claimed increases or decreases, an employee can update their elections at any time via the UKG website. 

Commissions will be paid on closed-won opportunities only when the Accounting Department has received payment from the customer. When payment has been received from the customer, commissions for the related sale(s) will be included in the first payroll of the month following receipt of payment. Upon termination or resignation, commissions will only be paid on closed-won opportunities executed during active employment. 

Commissions and bonuses are discretionary and subject to change without notice. Any circumstances that are not covered in this policy will be decided by management and Human Resources on a case-by-case basis. 

##### **3.) EMPLOYEE REFERRAL PROGRAM**  {#3.)-employee-referral-program}

HANNON HILL is always looking for qualified employees and appreciates recommendations made by existing employees. If you recommend someone who is hired on a permanent full-time basis and who is still employed at the organization after 120 days, you are eligible to be paid a recruiting bonus. The current recruiting bonus for a full-time employee is $2,000.00. Additional referral bonuses may be given for particular roles at HANNON HILL’s discretion. The bonuses are paid within the first payroll cycle after the new hire completes 120 days of employment. 

HANNON HILL management reserves the right to update the requirements and amounts of the recruiting bonus depending on the needs of the organization and existing market conditions. All bonuses are subject to management and Human Resources approval. 

##### 

##### **4.) PERSONNEL RECORDS**  {#4.)-personnel-records}

To keep HANNON HILL records current, it is extremely important that you notify the Human Resources Department of any changes in: 

\- Name and marital status

\- Address and telephone number 

\- Number of eligible dependents 

\- Federal and state tax deductions (payroll) 

\- Emergency contact 

You can make changes and updates to any of the aforementioned by accessing your personal information 

under the “MYSELF \-\> PERSONAL” tab in UKG. 

## **D. TIME OFF FROM WORK**  {#d.-time-off-from-work}

##### **1.) PAID FLEX LEAVE**  {#1.)-paid-flex-leave}

Full-Time employees will receive flex time each calendar year based on their years of service. The amount will vary according to your years of service. New hires with less than a year of service will receive a prorated amount of flex time and have a waiting period of 90 days. I.E. If your start date is January 1st, you will not be eligible for flex time until April 1st and will receive 11.25 days of flex time for the remainder of the calendar year. Part-Time employees and Interns are not eligible for paid time off from work. Rehires with a full-time status are eligible for paid time off from work, but they are considered a new hire and their time will reset. 

● 15 Days: 1-4 years of service 

● 20 Days: 5-9 years of service 

● 25 Days: 10 or more years of service 

Employees who are engaged in additional work projects that prevent them from using their allocated paid flex time may be eligible for up to (3) additional days of compensatory paid flex time. This time is intended to compensate employees for their additional workload and ensure they have adequate time for rest and recovery. 

Additional flex time will be granted only upon manager approval. Managers may consult with Human Resources if necessary before granting approval. Compensatory time paid flex time does not accrue from year to year, meaning it will not increase or accumulate beyond the approved (3) days. However, unused compensatory flex time can be rolled over into the next calendar year with all other accrued rollovers. 

Proper advance notice is required and it is the responsibility of each individual employee, not their manager, to make sure all work is covered before taking flex time away from the office. All flex time requests must be submitted to a direct manager and approved and reasonable notice should be given using the following guidelines: 

Give your manager at least: 

● Three (3) weeks prior notice for every one (1) work week or more of flex time 

● One (1) week prior notice for one to four (1 to 4\) work days of flex time 

● Two (2) work days prior notice for one-half (1/2) day of flex time 

● Requests for time off should be submitted in UKG

We lead busy lives and understand the need to attend appointments and events, handle home repairs, or other personal matters. If you need to take time away from work for a personal matter and the time taken is less than 4 hours, this time can be made up and does not have to be submitted as Paid Flex in UKG. Employees are responsible for notifying their manager and team of the time taken and it should be reflected

on their Google Calendar. Employees are responsible for making up the time missed, and this plan should be shared with their Manager. 

Employees should take no less than 10 days of flex time per year; ideally at least 5 in the first half of the year and at least 5 in the second half.

* With the introduction of the flex minimum, a $500 stipend will be available to employees when they take 3+ consecutive approved days of flex time. This stipend may be used for anything that the employee chooses and no receipts are required. The stipend will be awarded on the paycheck for the pay period in which the majority of the flex time was taken. It may be paid all at once or divided between two eligible periods of flex time throughout the year, however the total amount paid in one year may not exceed $500.   
    
  * To be eligible for the stipend, the employee must have already met or have plans to meet the minimum flex time usage for that year.   
  * A request must be submitted for the stipend to be paid. It will not automatically be paid when flex time is approved.   
  * Request Vacation stipend when requesting Flex PTO- Stipend cannot be paid out retroactively.   
  * The flex stipend is not paid out upon termination and does not roll over. 

Upon departure, unused FLEX days will be paid out for voluntary and involuntary terminations. 

ROLLOVER 

Throughout the year, employees are encouraged to make use of their flex time. We understand that it is not always possible or necessary to use the entire awarded balance each year, and that some years may present more opportunities for time off than others. 

Employees can rollover up to 15 FLEX days (120 hours) per calendar year. For unforeseen circumstances, please consult manager for consideration.

WAITING PERIOD 

New hires are eligible after 60 days of Full-Time employment. Exceptions require manager's approval. Any approved time taken during the waiting period will be deducted from the new hire's balance after the waiting-period has ended. New employees should notify the hiring manager of future plans for travel during onboarding or as soon as possible.

DECEMBER PAID FLEX LEAVE 

We are still open for business in December and must be staffed appropriately for our business needs and our clients’ needs. Each department must be 50% staffed during the month of December, e.g. if your department has 4 team members and 2 team members have requested off from December 18th-December 30th, a minimum of 2 team members are still required to be working on the business days we're open during that time period. Each department should do its best to ensure that its members are equitably covering staffing every year (e.g. the members who take vacation one year, should be the ones to remain staffed the next year, and so on).

##### **2.) PAID SICK LEAVE**  {#2.)-paid-sick-leave}

Each full-time employee is eligible for 8 paid sick days per calendar year. Absences due to illness may not allow for advance notice; however, HANNON HILL requests that employees who need to be absent due to illness notify their manager as soon as practical.

New hires with less than a year of service will have a waiting period of 90 days. Sick days can be used to care for a sick family member, but we ask that you include that detail in your request. 

In the event of a chronic illness in which an employee is absent 3 days or more, additional documentation may be requested. Managers reserve the right to request a doctor's note if an illness becomes frequent or prolonged and does not permit an employee to complete work obligations. Managers also reserve the right to send an employee home due to illness. Teleworking with an illness is permissible if the employee can work at least a ½ day and be productive. This must be approved by their direct manager. If the employee is going to miss more than 4 hours of work, they should not telework, but take a full sick day. Sick absences must be submitted in UKG.

Upon departure, unused SICK days will be paid out for voluntary and involuntary terminations. 

1) Appropriate use of Emergency Paid Sick Time vs. Sick Time: 

Employees should default to the most appropriate type of time off for each occurrence. 

2) Short Term Disability (STD) Considerations

If the medical occurrence pertains to the employee and they are unable to return to work after the permitted amount of days, and do not have other time off balances available for use, they will need to file for STD to continue to be paid. 

* The employee must be continuously disabled for 14 days for an accident and 14 days for a sickness before benefits will be paid for a covered disability.  
* Once the employee qualifies for benefits under this plan (eligibility begins after 1 month of employment), the maximum number of weekly disability benefits is 13 weeks for an accident and 13 weeks for a sickness. Disability benefits will end sooner if the employee no longer qualifies for benefits. Short-Term Disability will be capped at a maximum benefit period of 13 weeks. 

			  
If the occurrence qualifies for STD benefits, the employee should apply immediately. Human Resources can provide the necessary STD forms and offer guidance if needed. 

##### 

##### **4.) SELF-CARE DAYS**  {#4.)-self-care-days}

Full-Time employees are eligible for 2 self-care days each calendar year. This benefit is not eligible to be paid out upon voluntary or involuntary termination. Employees are eligible for $100 in self-care funds annually. These funds will be paid out at $50.00/self-care day. The stipend will be included in the payroll in which the self-care day is taken. This benefit is not eligible to be paid out upon voluntary or involuntary termination. 

##### **5.) VOLUNTEER DAYS**  {#5.)-volunteer-days}

Full-Time employees are eligible for 1 volunteer day each calendar year. Volunteer time must be requested in a minimum of ½ day increments. Proof of volunteer service must be submitted to be eligible for paid volunteer days. This benefit is not eligible to be paid out upon voluntary or involuntary termination. 

##### **7.) PARENTAL LEAVE**  {#7.)-parental-leave}

**Maternity Leave** 

HANNON HILL will provide 60% of weekly pay up to a maximum of $1,500.00 per week for twelve (12) weeks. Maternity Leave will be paid in accordance with the company short-term disability plan/policy, which pays 60% of weekly pay up to a maximum of $1,500.00 per week for natural births for the first 6 weeks. HANNON HILL will provide additional paid maternity leave of 60% of weekly pay up to a maximum of $1,500.00 per week for the remaining 6 weeks. 

Maternity Leave can be used for the birth of a child and to care for the newborn child. 

**Paternity/Child Adoption Leave** 

HANNON HILL will provide 60% of weekly pay up to a maximum of $1,500.00 per week for six (6) weeks for paid paternity leave and child adoption leave. Employees may supplement this benefit by using their accrued leave hours to cover any remaining pay gaps. 

Paternity and adoption leave can be used for: 

\- The placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care, and to care for the newly-placed child 

\- Care for a newborn child 

Health insurance benefits will continue to be provided during the paid maternity/paternity/adoption leave under this policy at the same rate in effect before the leave was taken. 

##### **3.) OTHER PAID LEAVE OPTIONS \-** 

HANNON HILL currently offers regular full-time employees short term disability (STD) and long term disability (LTD) coverage with Cigna. 

Coverage will begin on the first day of the month after an employee's start date. If the employee begins full-time employment on the first day of the month, coverage is effective the same day. Individual employee premiums are 100% covered by the Company with no out of pocket expense to the employee. 

Short Term Disability (STD) – Insurance that provides up to 12 weeks of paid leave at 60% of an employee’s salary. STD may be used for qualifying injury, illness or maternity leave. Employees are only eligible for one instance of STD leave per calendar year. Employees who require additional leave must contact the insurer directly for information concerning Long Term Disability.

Long Term Disability (LTD) – Insurance that provides paid leave after 12 weeks of STD has been used at 60% of an employee’s salary. LTD can last as long as the injury or illness persists, up to the social security retirement age of 67 years old. 

All employees on approved leaves of absences including short term, long term, parental, or any applicable federal or state leave will have no access to HANNON HILL devices or systems.

##### **5.) TELECOMMUTE/ REMOTE WORK POLICY**  {#5.)-telecommute/-remote-work-policy}

Telecommuting and working remotely comes with a high level of trust and communication expectations.

Employees with the privilege of telecommuting and working fully remotely are required to adhere to the following guidelines.

##### **10.) CORPORATE CREDIT CARD USE AND EXPENSE REPORT POLICY**  {#10.)-corporate-credit-card-use-and-expense-report-policy}

HANNON HILL defines business expense as cash outflow that is both customary and necessary to the company’s line of business. A business expense should be generally understood as expenditure incurred in pursuit of the company’s business goals or background operations 

Employees are required to obtain a manager's approval before incurring any business expenses on behalf of HANNON HILL. Employees have two (2) options to make company purchases:

a) Request a company credit card to use. If an employee is traveling with another employee who has a company credit card, this card should be used for business expenses. If an employee is in the office, a company credit card may be obtained from the Accounting Department. In either case, use of a company credit card will only be approved for legitimate business expenses. Employees should submit all receipts for credit card purchases to the Accounting Department as soon as possible after the charge is made. All receipts for charges made in a particular month should be submitted by the last day of that month at the latest. 

b) Obtain advance authorization to make the purchase, pay for the purchase, and request reimbursement. Please email HR and Accounting to chart total business expenses paid by the employee. Expense Reimbursements should be reviewed by the employee, approved by their direct manager, and submitted with all applicable receipts for review by the Accounting Department. Failure to provide an appropriate receipt may result in forfeiture of right to reimbursement. 

Please remember that under either of these options, an itemized receipt is required for **every** purchase made on behalf of the company. 

**Reimbursement for mileage** 

It may occasionally be necessary for an employee to utilize a personal vehicle for other than a home-to-office commute (i.e. to the location of a prospect or client or office errands). In this event, the employee should email HR and submit reimbursement for mileage and list each leg of the trip and total miles-driven to support the number of miles. The employee will only be reimbursed based on the federal government standard mileage rate. Mileage reimbursement amount is based on the current IRS mileage rate for the year in which the travel takes place. Manager’s approval must be obtained prior to the employee getting reimbursed for mileage. In this situation reimbursement for mileage serves as a comprehensive estimate of all costs associated with the transportation. 

Any actual costs that arise, including fuel charges and repairs, will not be considered for reimbursement. 

Please note that mileage from an employee’s residence to the HANNON HILL office is never reimbursable unless otherwise stated in the employee’s offer letter. Mileage to and from an airport or when driving to a travel location on HANNON HILL company business counts as a commute and is never reimbursable unless stated otherwise in the employee’s offer letter. 

**Per Diem Policy \- for employee business meals while traveling** 

When an employee travels on behalf of HANNON HILL to conduct a training session, to provide an on-site 

demonstration, or to attend a conference or trade show, the employee will be subject to the company’s Per Diem Policy for meals. The intention of this policy is to guarantee employees sufficient reimbursement for healthy food selections, while allowing flexibility for the employees’ personal preferences. Regardless of what employees spend per day on meals for themselves, each employee will be reimbursed based on the rate specified by the federal government for Meals and Incidental Expenses (M\&IE) at www.gsa.gov/portal/category/21287. This rate will change based on the destination of the employee’s travel. 

In order to implement this policy, traveling employees are asked to only use personal means to purchase meals for themselves and to include earned days of per diem. If the employee is traveling for on-site training, and expenses are to be billed through to the client, the employee should still submit receipts for meals to HR and the Accounting Department (even though they will not be used to calculate reimbursement). This is to enable the Accounting Department to satisfy the potential request of clients to supply as confirmation of expenses. 

Please note that if an employee is entertaining a client or prospect for business purposes, the Per Diem Policy does not apply, and the employee should make purchases by one of the two options explained above. HANNON HILL management asks that employees use their best judgment to determine what are and are not appropriate expenditures in this circumstance. 

##### **11.) TRAVELING ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY**  {#11.)-traveling-on-behalf-of-the-company}

The travel policy applies to all individuals on Hannon Hill’s payroll who are acting on behalf of Hannon Hill including contractors, interns, and part-time and full-time staff. Travel is defined as out of city, state, or country business trips, including one-day trips that do not fall within an employee’s normal work location(s). 

Driving to and from an airport or travel location on Hannon Hill company business counts as a standard commute and is not eligible for mileage reimbursement unless otherwise specified in the employee’s offer letter. 

In order for travel related expenses and per diem reimbursements to be paid by the company, approval must be granted in writing by the employee’s manager prior to making travel plans. All company paid travel expenses must be for justifiable business purposes. Whether or not the purpose is justified is at the discretion of the manager on a case by case basis. 

While traveling, employees must adhere to the travel-specific policies outlined in section F.8 and section F.10 which detail dress code and company credit card usage. 

Employees traveling on behalf of Hannon Hill should conduct themselves in a manner that positively represents the company at all times. This includes time that is not spent in the presence of a client such as in the airport, etc. 

If travel occurs on a work day, the employee should make every reasonable effort to complete a full day’s worth of work. Hannon Hill will pay for reasonable expenses required to work while traveling. If the employee is unable to work on a travel day, they should let their manager know. 

Employees must adhere to the safety and sanitation guidelines of their travel and/or event destination. It is the responsibility of the employee to make themselves aware of the local guidelines prior to arranging travel plans. If the employee is not willing or able to adhere to local guidelines, they must speak with their manager to make alternate arrangements. 

Employees who conduct on-site work on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) that requires travel to support Hannon Hill business functions will receive a half day (four hours) of flex time added to their UKG balance. Travel time by itself, regardless of length or day of the week that it takes place, does not qualify for flex time if no significant on-site work is done on that day. Work done from the employee’s primary work site(s)on weekends that falls within the normal day-to-day or week-to-week scope of duties does not qualify for flex time. The amount of flex time will not increase or decrease regardless of the actual number of hours spent on qualifying work in a single weekend. Final approval is at the discretion of the employee’s manager and not guaranteed. The manager may request details on or documentation of work done prior to final approval. Employees should contact their manager and Human Resources if they are unsure whether or not their planned work will qualify for flex time. 

Employees are expected to follow all policies stated in this policy manual while traveling when/if applicable and appropriate.

##### **12.) SOCIAL MEDIA **  {#12.)-social-media}

At Hannon Hill, we understand that social media can be a fun and rewarding way to share your life and opinions with family, friends and co-workers around the world. However, use of social media also presents certain risks and carries with it certain responsibilities. To assist you in making responsible decisions about your use of social media, we have established these guidelines for appropriate use of social media. 

This policy applies to all employees who work for Hannon Hill. 

**Social Media Guidelines** 

In the rapidly expanding world of digital communication, *social media* can mean many things. *Social media* includes all means of communicating or posting information or content of any sort on the Internet, including to your own or someone else's blog, personal website, social networking or affinity website, web bulletin board or a chatroom, whether or not associated or affiliated with Hannon Hill, as well as any other form of digital communication. 

The same principles and guidelines found in Hannon Hill policies, mission and values apply to your activities online. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for what you post online. Before creating online content, consider some of the risks and rewards that are involved. Keep in mind that any of your conduct that adversely affects your job performance, the performance of fellow employees or otherwise adversely

affects customers, suppliers, people who work on behalf of Hannon Hill or Hannon Hill’s legitimate business interests may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. 

**Know and Follow the Rules** 

Carefully read these guidelines, the Hannon Hill Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement, the Hannon Hill Anti-Harassment Policy, the Hannon Hill Conflict of Interest and Confidential Nature of Work and ensure your postings are consistent with these policies. Inappropriate postings that may include discriminatory remarks, harassment, and threats of violence or similar inappropriate or unlawful conduct will not be tolerated and may subject you to disciplinary action up to and including termination. 

**Be Respectful** 

Always be fair and courteous to fellow employees, customers, suppliers or people who work on behalf of Hannon Hill. Also, keep in mind that you are more likely to resolve work-related complaints by speaking directly with your co-workers or by utilizing our Open Door Policy than by posting complaints to a social media outlet. Nevertheless, if you decide to post complaints or criticism, avoid using statements, 

photographs, video or audio that reasonably could be viewed as malicious, obscene, threatening or intimidating, that falsely disparage customers, team members, or suppliers, or that might constitute harassment or bullying. Examples of such conduct might include offensive posts meant to intentionally harm someone's reputation or posts that could contribute to a hostile work environment on the basis of race, sex, disability, religion or any other status protected by law or company policy. 

**Be Honest and Accurate** 

Make sure you are always honest and accurate when posting information or news, and if you make a mistake, correct it quickly. Be open about any previous posts you have altered. Remember that the Internet archives almost everything; therefore, even deleted postings can be searched. Never post any information or rumors that you know to be false about Hannon Hill, fellow team members, customers, suppliers, people working on behalf of Hannon Hill or competitors. 

**Post Only Appropriate and Respectful Content** 

● Maintain the confidentiality of Hannon Hill trade secrets and private or confidential information. 

● Respect financial disclosure laws. It is illegal to communicate or give a "tip" on inside information to others so that they may buy or sell stocks or securities. 

● Do not create a link from your blog, website or other social networking site to a Hannon Hill website without identifying yourself as a Hannon Hill employee. 

● Express only your personal opinions. Never represent yourself as a spokesperson for Hannon Hill. If Hannon Hill is a subject of the content you are creating, be clear and open about the fact that you are an employee and make it clear that your views do not represent those of Hannon Hill, fellow employees, customers, suppliers or people working on behalf of Hannon Hill. If you do publish a blog or post online related to the work you do or subjects associated with Hannon Hill, make it clear that you are not speaking on behalf of Hannon Hill. It is best to include a disclaimer such as "The postings on this site are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Hannon Hill." 

**Using Social Media at Work** 

Refrain from using social media while on work time or on equipment we provide, unless it is work-related as authorized by your manager or consistent with the Company Equipment Policy. Do not use Hannon Hill email addresses to register on social networks, blogs or other online tools utilized for personal use. 

**Retaliation is Prohibited** 

Hannon Hill prohibits taking negative action against any team member for reporting a possible deviation from this policy or for cooperating in an investigation. Any team member who retaliates against another team member for reporting a possible deviation from this policy or for cooperating in an investigation will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 

**Media Contacts**
