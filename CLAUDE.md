# AI Configs Project

This repository contains personal configuration files and profiles for AI assistants to better understand Matthew Wren's preferences, context, and needs.

## Project Purpose

This is a personal knowledge base that helps AI assistants provide tailored support across multiple domains:
- Financial planning and preferences
- Travel planning and history
- Personal productivity and ADHD management
- Fitness coaching (cycling and weightlifting)
- Music education (trumpet)

## Repository Structure

- `financial-profile.md` - Financial preferences, goals, and context
- `travel-profile.md` - Travel preferences, history, and planning details
- `personal-assistant.md` - ADHD productivity system, fitness coaching, and trumpet guidance
- `data/` - Supporting documentation and reference materials

## Instructions for AI Assistants

1. **Privacy First**: These files contain personal information. Never suggest committing sensitive data like account numbers, passwords, or private addresses.

2. **Context Awareness**: When working with Matthew, reference these profiles to provide personalized guidance that aligns with his goals, preferences, and constraints.

3. **ADHD-Friendly Communication**:
   - Keep responses clear, structured, and actionable
   - Use visual organization (tables, lists, emojis where helpful)
   - Break complex tasks into manageable steps
   - Provide specific next actions, not just advice

4. **Consistency**: When updating these profiles, maintain the existing format and structure. These are living documents that evolve over time.

5. **Don't Assume**: If something is unclear or missing from the profiles, ask Matthew directly rather than making assumptions.

## Working with This Project

- These are reference files, not code - edit carefully and only when explicitly requested
- When suggesting changes, explain the reasoning
- Maintain markdown formatting for readability
- Keep information current and remove outdated content
