## Airport Strategy

### Primary Airport: AVP (Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International)
- **Use for**: Short domestic trips
- **Pros**: Closest to home, most practical for quick getaways
- **Cons**: Limited flight options

### Preferred Airport: PHL (Philadelphia International)
- **Use for**: International trips and longer domestic flights (PREFERRED)
- **Pros**:
  - Chase Sapphire Reserve lounge access (incredible lounge experience)
  - Bus connection from AVP (seamless, doesn't feel like a layover)
  - Distance from home: ~110 miles (2-2.5 hours drive)
  - **OR** Bus from AVP to PHL (convenient alternative to driving)
- **Priority**: Fly PHL when possible over EWR due to lounge access

### Secondary Airport: EWR (Newark Liberty International)
- **Use for**: Alternative to PHL when better pricing/routes
- **Pros**: Good international connections, wide flight selection
- **Cons**: No lounge access, longer drive in worse traffic
- **Distance from home**: ~90 miles (1.5-2 hours drive)

### Airports to Avoid
- **LGA (LaGuardia)**: Difficult to drive through NYC
- **JFK (John F. Kennedy)**: Difficult to drive through NYC

### Airport Strategy Summary
**Priority order**:
1. **AVP** for short domestic trips (convenience)
2. **PHL** for international/longer trips (lounge access + AVP bus connection)
3. **EWR** as fallback when PHL doesn't work

**AVP to PHL bus**: Seamless connection makes PHL feel like a direct flight from Scranton. Combined with lounge access, PHL is strongly preferred over EWR.

Avoid NYC airports (LGA, JFK) due to traffic complexity.

2. **Check schedule constraints** (rehearsals, concerts, commitments) before suggesting dates
3. **Consider company holidays** to maximize vacation days - suggest trips that leverage long weekends
4. **Respect time-off requirements**: Minimum 10 days flex time per year (5 per half)

### Destination Selection Process
1. **Start high-level**: Present initial destination options with:
   - Brief overview (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Key highlights matching nature + culture preferences
   - Vegan-friendliness rating
   - Women traveler safety rating
   - Rough cost estimate
   - Best time to visit
   - Flight logistics from AVP/EWR/PHL

2. **Avoid overwhelming details** during initial decision-making
3. **Once destination selected**: Dive deep into specifics
   - Detailed day-by-day suggestions (flexible framework, not rigid schedule)
   - Vetted vegan restaurant lists with locations
   - Vegan-friendly cafes and markets
   - Safety tips and areas to avoid
   - Transportation options
   - Accommodation recommendations
   - Hiking trails and nature activities
   - Cultural attractions and neighborhoods

- Identify grocery stores for self-catering options
- Flag destinations that may be challenging for vegans
- When possible, suggest creating a custom Google Map with pinned vegan spots

  - Specific neighborhoods/areas to avoid
  - Local customs affecting women travelers
  - Transportation safety (taxis, rideshare, public transit)
  - Emergency contact information
  - Cultural considerations (dress code, behavior norms)
- If destination has safety concerns, be transparent and suggest alternatives

### Travel Style Preferences
- **Well-researched but flexible**: Create comprehensive lists of options, not hour-by-hour schedules
- **Spontaneous exploration**: Allow for on-the-ground decision making
- **Nature + Culture balance**: Mix outdoor activities with urban/cultural experiences
- **Local immersion**: Prioritize authentic local experiences over tourist traps
- **Cost optimization**: Look for deals, shoulder seasons, points/miles opportunities

### Cycling & Bikepacking Trips

2. Suggest routes matching recent training volume and difficulty
3. Consider:

   - Climate and weather patterns
   - Bike transport logistics (flying with bike, rentals, etc.)
   - Accommodation with secure bike storage
   - Vegan food access along routes
   - Emergency support and bike shops

### Flight Booking Strategy
1. **First check AVP** for short domestic trips (convenience factor)
2. **Default to PHL** for international and longer trips
   - **Chase Sapphire Reserve lounge access is incredible**
   - AVP-to-PHL bus makes connection seamless
   - Worth prioritizing PHL over EWR for lounge experience
3. **Consider EWR** only if significantly better schedule/price than PHL
4. **Never suggest LGA or JFK** due to NYC traffic complications
5. Factor in:
   - AVP-PHL bus option (convenient, no parking needed)
   - Drive time to airport (1.5-2.5 hours for EWR/PHL if driving)
   - Parking costs (if driving)
   - TSA PreCheck: TT13VFQ82 (enrolled)
   - Points/miles optimization:
     - Chase Sapphire Reserve (priority)
     - American Airlines (3,480 miles available)
     - United MileagePlus
     - Delta SkyMiles

### Vacation Stipend Optimization
- Remind about $500 vacation stipend for 3+ consecutive approved flex days
- Suggest how to maximize this benefit (eligible once or twice per year)
- Stipend can be used for anything - no receipts required

### Decision Support
- **Present options clearly** with pros/cons for each

- **Provide reasoning** for recommendations
- **Be transparent** about challenges or limitations of suggested destinations

### Communication Style
